# Botmock JS Client
=========

A thin client around the botmock API.

## Installation

  `npm install botmock`


## Getting Started

In order to get started with this client, you'll need to get your access token from https://botmock.com. After you sign in, go to the *Account Settings* page by clicking on your profile picture on the top right. Then click on *API* from the left side menu. Give your token a name, and hit *Create*. Remember to note down your token since it will not be shown after it is generated.


## Usage

```
// Import the botmock js library
const Botmock = require('botmock-js');

// Create a client
const CLIENT = new Botmock({
    "api_token": API_TOKEN,
    "debug": false // this flag is optional.
});
```

In general, the client acts like a thin wrapper around the REST API. You can read about the API here: http://docs.botmock.com/

The client allows easy access to 3 types of resources.

client.teams(team_id)
